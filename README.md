### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##### Presently, i'm building a website which will serve as a blogging platform. My progression thus far can be seen in the 'django-blog' repo. I'm also building a data visualization tool with Tableau. 

##### I primarily build programs with Python, for automation and data analysis. I pair this with HTML and CSS to build web applications, using the Django framework. I've also built programs with R for data analysis as well. 

##### My interests inlcude:
