### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##### Presently, i'm building a website which will serve as a blog platform. My progression thus far can be seen in the 'django-blog' repo. I'm also building a data visualization tool with Tableau. 

##### I primarily write code in Python. I pair this with HTML and CSS to build web applications, using the Django framework. I've used R for data analysis and statistical modeling as well.

##### My interests inlcude:
* Full-Stack Development
* Test Automation
* Data Analysis & Visualization
